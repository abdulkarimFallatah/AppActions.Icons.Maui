# AppActions.Icons.Maui

A .NET MAUI library that provides some default icons for AppActions without having to create your own.

Based on iOS' [Home Screen Quick Action Icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/system-icons#home-screen-quick-action-icons), this library provides similar icons for both Android & Windows, but styled towards the platforms default design style. Also supports the use of [SFSymbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) as Icons on iOS.
